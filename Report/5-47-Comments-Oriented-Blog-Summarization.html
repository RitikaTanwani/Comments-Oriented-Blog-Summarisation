    <div class="ire2014_abstract">
        Comments are very important part of blog posts. Most of the research done on blog 
        summarization didn’t consider comments.   Comments gives the general view of 
        readers and can be used to identify most   relevant sentences from original post. The 
        proposed solution is to derive relevant   comments and then retrieve post sentences 
        mostly referred to by these comments. The   relevant comments are identified by 
        ReT(Response and Topic)   graph and   named entities similarity score. Followed 
        by summation-based sentence selection   showed promising results. 

    </div>
    
    <div class="ire2014_report">
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">1. Introduction</h3>
        Most of the blogs have comments associated with them. A recent study on
        blog conversation showed that readers treat comments associated with a post as an
        inherent part of the post [2]. These comments gives the general opinion about
        the blog post and this knowledge can then be used to extract most relevant sentences
        from the blog post.
        
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">2. Problem Statement & Related Work</h3>
        Given a document D consisting of a set of sentences D ={s1 , s2 , . . . , sn }, and a
        set of comments C = {c1 , c2 , . . . , cl } associated with D, the task of comments-oriented document summarization is to extract a subset of sentences from D, denoted by Sc (Sc ⊂ D), 
        that best represents the topic(s) presented in D and discussed among its comments C. <br/><br/>

        We have referred the  ReQuT (i.e., Reader, Quotation,and Topic) model of Meishan Hu, Aixin Sun and Ee-Peng Lim ,Centre for Advanced Information Systems, School of Computer Engineering,Nanyang Technological University, Singapore as the base model for the summary generation.

        We have augmented this ReQut with the Named Entity Recognition which is done by the stanford entity tagger (Stanford CoreNLP v1.3.4 – 2012-11-12).

        
        <h3 class="ire2014_h3">3. Approach</h3>
        Each word in the comment gets a weight from the different factors. The words that
        qualify a certain threshold are considered for the summary generation. <br/>
        The factors are as follows : <br/>
        A. Representative words extraction from
        comments:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Reader's authority: <br/>
                The reader's authority is calculated as the number of distinct user that post a reply to
                the users comment.<br/>
                Contribution to the weight of the term = tf(term,ci) * A(ci) <br/>
                where, <br/>
                <ul>
                    <li> tf(term,ci) is the term frequency of
                the word in the comment ci</li>
                    <li> A(ci) is the authority author of the                
                comment ci</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Likes count: The number of likes to a comment <br/>
                Contribution to the weight of the term = L(Ci) <br/>
                where, <br/> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> L(Ci) = number of likes on the comment</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Cluster: we have a algorithm that clusters the comments and a weight is assigned to a
                cluster. <br/> 
                Contribution to the weight of the term = tf(term,ci)*W(ci) <br/>
                where, <br/> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> tf(term,ci) is the term frequency of the word in the comment ci</li>
                        <li> W(ci) weight of the cluster to which the comment belongs</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Reply count : The number of replies a comment has got.<br/>
                Contribution to weight of the term = Rep(Ci)
                where, <br/> 
                    <ul>
                        <li> Ci = number of replies to the comment Ci</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                Named Entity: All the named entities of blog post are identified by using Stanford
                CoreNLP[2]. <br/>For each comment Named Entity Score E(Ci) is calculated as : <br/>
                E(Ci) = Number of named entities in that comment <br/>
                Contribution to the weight of the term = E(Ci) <br/>
            </li>
        </ol>

        B. Top sentence extraction from Blog post:
        <ol>
            <li> The blog is divided into sentences.</li>
            <li> Each sentence is then represented by a bag of words and weightage is given by <br/>
            W(Si)=Sum(W(Ti))|Ti belongs to Si <br/>
            where,
            <ul>
                <li> W(Si) = weightage of the sentence Si <li>
                <li> W(Ti) = weightage of the term Ti as </li>
            calculated in A.</li>
            <li> A number of top weighted sentences is shown as the summary.</li>
        </ol>


        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">3.1. Assumptions</h4>
        Proposed Solution gives a good output summary for long blog posts and sufficient number of comments associated with it.
        <br/><br/>
        
        <h4 class="ire2014_h4">3.2. Architecture</h4>
        
        Given a blog post and its comments, our solution consists of three modules (illustrated in the Figure  below): 
        Sentence detection : splits blog post content into sentences.
        Word representativeness :  measure weighs words appearing in comments.
        Sentence selection : computes a representativeness score for each sentence based on representativeness of its contained words.
